# Learning Vulkan

This repo is a means of documenting my journey with learning Vulkan's basics on windows. Because of the binaries in the LunarG VulkanSDK I decided to use the MSVC compiler. I used Build Tools 2017. 

If you want to see this thing working - make sure you have `glm` and the `vulkan sdk` installed, and that you have added the directory in which your `vsdevcmd` lies to `PATH`.

It may still not work though!
I guess this whole thing is just a mental "note to self".

To run:
`./compile_and_run`

Expected results:
